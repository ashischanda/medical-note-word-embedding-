# Pre-trained embedding for medical note words

word2vec, fasttext, glove

Dataset: MIMIC III, Chest-Xray dataset, Clinical dataset
MIMIC (only discharge notes)

It takes time to pre-process dataset and train model. Some people may also face memory problem to load whole dataset. We follow standard (or default) parameters and gensim library to train the model.

We also show a downstream task. 
We add an archive file and refer recent+previous research works.
